         * binary literals:
         * A binary literal is a number represented in binary (0s and 1s). In Java, you can use binary literals for integral types such as byte , short , int , and long . To specify a binary literal, prefix the number with 0b or 0B . This allows you to define numbers in binary format directly in your code.
         * 
         * for example 101 binary is equal to 5 in deca system.
         * syntax: 
         * int var = 0bvalue;
         * int var = 0b101;output will be 5 when you will print var.
         * 
         * similarly hexadecimal literals:
         * A hexadecimal integer literal begins with the 0 digit followed by either an x or X, followed by any combination of the digits 0 through 9 and the letters a through f or A through F. The letters A (or a) through F (or f) represent the values 10 through 15, respectively.
         * 
         * int var = 0xvalue;
         * 
         * in java we can add underscores between digits to distinguish them.
         * for ex:
         * int var = 10_00_000;
         * 
         * we can use epsilon(e) to store large values in double.
         * double var = 12e10;//->12*(10^10)
         * 
         * in java we can increment the char;
         * for ex:
         * char var = 'a';
         * var++;
         * System.out.println(var);output -> b
         *
