         * inheritance in java:
         * why do we need inheritance?
         * ->suppose we have a operating system class which contains all the data about O.S (like windows ,linux ,Mac)
         * -> now we have many other classes named laptop1,lap2... which have to create a full fledged P.C. including O.S.
         * ->To save the time all the laptop will inherit the O.S from the O.S class 
         * 
         * so here the O.S class is called Base class and other classes are called derived class:
         * 
         * Base -> derived
         * Parent -> child
         * Super -> sub
         * 
         * to inherit a class1 to class2 we use keyword 'extends':
         * 
         * ex:
         * 
         * syntax:
         * public class class2 extends class1 
         * {
         *      //operations.
         * }
         */
